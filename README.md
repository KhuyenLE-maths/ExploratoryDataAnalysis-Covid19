# Exploratory Data Analysis - Covid19

Analyzing data is a important task in a Machine Learning project. It helps to understand the data as much as possible, so that we can figure out a suitable machine learning model fitting to our data. 

In this task, we are going to discover a variety of functions to visualize the structure data, which is saved in .xlsx format. 
The dataset in this project contains anonymized data patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This data is collected from Kaggle.
